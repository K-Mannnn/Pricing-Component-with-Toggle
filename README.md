## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project has been a good learning curve both in terms of Html markup and CSS properties especially pseudo classes and CSS specificity. As laid out by the creator of this challenge, I used only CSS and html to get the toggle functionality and switching displays going (no javascript), so discovered some CSS limitations and some new properties along the way. 

### Continued development

I have not been able to create the keyboad control affect on the toggle switch, that's I would like to learn anf improve on.
